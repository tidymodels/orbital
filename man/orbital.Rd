\title{Turn tidymodels objects into orbital objects}
\usage{
orbital(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted workflow, parsnip, or recipes object.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}
}
\value{
An \link{orbital} object.
}
\description{
Fitted workflows, parsnip objects, and recipes objects can be turned into an
orbital object that contain all the information needed to perform
predictions.
}
\details{
An orbital object contains all the information that is needed to perform
predictions. This makes the objects substantially smaller than the original
objects. The main downside with this object is that all the input checking
has been removed, and it is thus up to the user to make sure the data is
correct.

The printing of orbital objects reduce the number of significant digits for
easy viewing, the can be changes by using the \code{digits} argument of \code{print()}
like so \code{print(orbital_object, digits = 10)}. The printing likewise truncates
each equation to fit on one line. This can be turned off using the \code{truncate}
argument like so \code{print(orbital_object, truncate = FALSE)}.

Full list of supported models and recipes steps can be found here:
\code{vignette("supported-models")}.

These objects will not be useful by themselves. They can be used to
\link[=predict.orbital_class]{predict()} with, or to generate code using functions
such as \code{\link[=orbital_sql]{orbital_sql()}} or \code{\link[=orbital_dt]{orbital_dt()}}.
