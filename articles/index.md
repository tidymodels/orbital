### Get started

- [Introduction to
  orbital](https://orbital.tidymodels.org/articles/orbital.md):

  Start here if this is your first time using orbital! You will learn
  how to convert a fitted workflow into an orbital object for
  lightweight prediction.

### Orbital

- [Supported Models and recipes
  steps](https://orbital.tidymodels.org/articles/supported-models.md):

  A complete list of supported parsnip models, recipes steps, and tailor
  adjustments that can be converted to orbital objects.

- [Pros and Cons](https://orbital.tidymodels.org/articles/pros-cons.md):

  Weigh the benefits and limitations of using orbital for prediction to
  determine if it’s right for your use case.

### SQL and deployment

- [Supported
  backends](https://orbital.tidymodels.org/articles/databases.md):

  Examples of running predictions in some of the known supported
  backends including SQLite, Spark, DuckDB, and Arrow.

- [Database
  deployment](https://orbital.tidymodels.org/articles/database-deployment.md):

  Deploy orbital predictions to a database by creating tables or views,
  with guidance on when to use each approach.

- [SQL expression
  sizes](https://orbital.tidymodels.org/articles/sql-size.md):

  Understand how model type and hyperparameters affect the size of
  generated SQL, and learn strategies for keeping queries manageable.

- [Parallel tree evaluation in
  databases](https://orbital.tidymodels.org/articles/separate-trees.md):

  Use the separate_trees argument to enable parallel evaluation of tree
  ensembles and avoid expression depth limits in databases.

- [Float precision at split
  boundaries](https://tidypredict.tidymodels.org/articles/float-precision.html):

  How 32-bit vs 64-bit float differences can affect tree model
  predictions.
